<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->

<!-- ## About The Project

[![Product Name Screen Shot][product-screenshot]](https://example.com)

Here's a blank template to get started: To avoid retyping too much info. Do a search and replace with your text editor for the following: `github_username`, `repo_name`, `twitter_handle`, `linkedin_username`, `email`, `email_client`, `project_title`, `project_description`

<p align="right">(<a href="#top">back to top</a>)</p> -->

## Built With

-   [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/)

-   Root Theming (Color, breakpoint, etc..), StyleProps/ Gradient/ CSS Variables /Etc... (SEMANTIC CHALLENGER)
-   [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org)
-   A database
-   [Apollo](https://www.apollographql.com)
-   (GRAPHQL) REST CHALLENGER Object, Query, Mutation, Subscription. Dynamic field querying / Apollo Server/Client to manage GraphQL (cache)
-   [Prisma](https://www.prisma.io)
-   ORM to manage database & data, generates type
-   [Nexus](https://nexusjs.org)
-   From SDL to code description for GraphQL, autogenerated types, and typesafety
-   [Formik](https://formik.org)
-   React form made easy

## Notes

-   Adding <QueryResult> to a page that is statically rendered is probably useless since the loaded state will always be false. _The loading will be done at build time_. I project to use SSR so... it's not gonna be a problem long term wise
